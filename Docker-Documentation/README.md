# Docker Documentation

## 1. Container Architecture

### Dockerfile Overview

The `Dockerfile` defines the steps needed to build a Docker image for your FastAPI application. It starts from a Python 3.9 slim image and sets up the necessary environment for the application to run.

- **Base Image**: `python:3.9-slim`  
  This image is a minimal version of Python 3.9, designed to keep the image size small while still supporting Python-based applications.

- **Working Directory**: `/my-app`  
  This is the directory inside the container where the application will reside.

- **Install Dependencies**:  
  The `requirements.txt` file is copied into the container, and then all dependencies listed inside are installed using `pip`.

- **Application Code**:  
  The rest of the application code is copied into the container. This allows your FastAPI application to be available inside the container.

- **Expose Port**:  
  Port `8000` is exposed, which is the default port for FastAPI to run.

- **CMD**:  
  The command to run the FastAPI application is set using `uvicorn`, which serves the FastAPI app. The `--reload` flag enables hot reloading during development.

### Docker Compose Overview

The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the multi-container setup, defining services for the FastAPI application and the PostgreSQL database. It simplifies the process of managing multiple containers and their dependencies.

#### Services

1. **App (FastAPI Service)**:
   - **Build Configuration**:  
     The app is built from the current directory (with `Dockerfile` located in the `Docker/` folder).  
     The environment variables needed for the app to function are pulled from a `.env` file.

   - **Ports**:  
     Port 8000 is mapped from the container to the host, so you can access the FastAPI application from `localhost:8000`.

   - **Environment Variables**:  
     These variables, such as `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ALGORITHM`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, are defined in the `.env` file and used by the app for database connections and JWT token management.

   - **Depends On**:  
     The app service depends on the `db` service (PostgreSQL), ensuring that the database container starts before the FastAPI app.

2. **Database (PostgreSQL Service)**:
   - **Image**:  
     The official `postgres:13` image is used to run the PostgreSQL database.

   - **Environment Variables**:  
     The database credentials are configured via the `.env` file with `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB`.

   - **Volumes**:  
     A named volume `postgres_data` is used to persist the database data, ensuring that data is retained even if the container is stopped or recreated.

#### Volumes

- **postgres_data**:  
  This is a named volume that stores PostgreSQL data persistently, located at `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in the container. It ensures that the database persists across container restarts.

To view all Docker volumes, run:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

## 2. Volume Management

In Docker, volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data in Docker, as they provide a more efficient and flexible way of managing data compared to bind mounts.

This project uses Docker volumes for persistent data storage of the PostgreSQL database.

### Creating and Managing Volumes

In our `docker-compose.yml`, the `postgres_data` volume is defined for the database service. This ensures that the PostgreSQL container's data is stored persistently even if the container is stopped or removed.

Hereâ€™s the relevant portion of the `docker-compose.yml` that defines the volume:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: postgres_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Persistent data storage

volumes:
  postgres_data:
    # Volume to store the database data
```


## 3. Docker Development and Production Configurations

### Development Configuration

In the development environment, the goal is to facilitate fast iteration while developing your application. Docker provides the following development configuration:

#### Dockerfile (Development Mode)
In the `Dockerfile`, we use the `--reload` flag with `uvicorn` to enable automatic reloading of the FastAPI application when changes are made to the source code.


```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /my-app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Expose port 8000
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the FastAPI application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]

```

#### docker-compose.yml (Development Mode)

The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to work with PostgreSQL and FastAPI in a development environment. It will automatically reload the FastAPI application on changes and make the application available at `localhost:8000`.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  # Application service
  app:
    build:
      context: .  # Build from the current directory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile  # Dockerfile for FastAPI application
    container_name: fastapi_app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"  # Expose FastAPI application on port 8000
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}  # Pull the DATABASE_URL from the .env file
      - SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY}      # Pull the SECRET_KEY from the .env file
      - ALGORITHM=${ALGORITHM}        # Pull the ALGORITHM from the .env file
      - ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=${ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES}  # Pull the expiration time for access tokens
    depends_on:
      - db  # Ensure the database service starts before the app

  # Database service (PostgreSQL)
  db:
    image: postgres:13  # Use official PostgreSQL image
    container_name: postgres_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}         # Use POSTGRES_USER from the .env file
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} # Use POSTGRES_PASSWORD from the .env file
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}             # Use POSTGRES_DB from the .env file
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Persistent data storage

volumes:
  postgres_data:  # Create a named volume to persist database data
```

### Production Configuration

#### Dockerfile (Production Mode)

In the production environment, we remove the `--reload` flag to avoid unnecessary overhead. Additionally, it is recommended to use `gunicorn` for serving the FastAPI application for better performance in production.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /my-app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Expose port 8000
EXPOSE 8000

# Install gunicorn for production use
RUN pip install gunicorn

# Command to run the FastAPI application using gunicorn (no --reload flag in production)
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

```


#### docker-compose.yml (Production Mode)

The docker-compose.yml file remains mostly the same as Development Mode, but you may need to change some configuration based on the `production database` and `environment variables`.
